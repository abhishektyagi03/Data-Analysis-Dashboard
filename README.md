# Coffee Sales Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Power bi, creating multiple dashboard and table and charts to analyze the data. This process involved several stages including data processing ,data cleaning and data visulization
Coffee Sales Dashboard Description
The Coffee Sales Dashboard is a dynamic, visual reporting tool designed to monitor, analyze, and interpret key sales metrics within the coffee retail business. It presents real-time insights into product performance, revenue trends, customer preferences, and regional sales distributions. By consolidating data into interactive charts, tables, and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for managers, marketing teams, and inventory planners.

Dashboard Features
Total Sales Overview – Displays daily, weekly, and monthly sales in revenue and units sold.

Top-Selling Coffee Products – Highlights top-performing items by quantity and sales value.

Sales by Region/Store – Visualizes geographic sales distribution via maps or bar charts.

Customer Preferences – Shows trends in product types (e.g., espresso, latte, cold brew).

Time-Based Trends – Line charts that reveal seasonal demand, peak sales times, or monthly growth.

Inventory Indicators – Flags low-stock or high-turnover products.

Performance Comparisons – Benchmarks current sales against previous periods or targets.

Process to Build and Use the Dashboard
Data Collection

Extract sales data from point-of-sale (POS) systems, online orders, and customer feedback tools.

Include attributes such as product name, quantity, price, location, date/time, and customer segment.

Data Cleaning and Transformation

Use data tools (e.g., Excel, Power Query, Python, or SQL) to clean missing or inconsistent entries.

Transform raw data into structured tables suitable for analysis.

Data Integration

Load cleaned data into a centralized database or BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, Looker, or Excel).

Establish data relationships (e.g., linking product codes with inventory or region tables).

Dashboard Design

Choose appropriate visuals: bar charts for top sellers, maps for regional sales, and gauges for KPIs.

Apply filters and slicers for date range, product category, or region.

Ensure visuals are aligned and use color coding for clarity.

Deployment and Sharing

Publish the dashboard to a shared platform or cloud service for stakeholder access.

Set up automated refresh schedules for real-time data updates.

Usage and Decision-Making

Use dashboard insights to adjust inventory, target marketing, and optimize pricing strategies.
